              <h2>brand history</h2>

              <p><strong>desk</strong> was started in 2005 in Vancouver, Canada by the Richards family. Abigail Richards, the Co-Founder, was a teacher and was disatisfied with the stationary products supplied to her school as well as other options on the market. She found them to be either to expensive or lacking in quality and decided to pursue other options. That lead to eventual brainstorming with her husband Frank Richards, an Engineer, and <strong>desk</strong> was born. They began work on crafting higher quality products at a rate that teachers and others in her community could afford. Since then, <strong>desk</strong> has grown to over 5,000 employees and locations all around Canada.</p>

              <h2>brand philosophies</h2>

              <p>When <strong>desk</strong> was started, the goal was to create high-quality products at a cheaper price and in our 15 years in business, we have not wavered from that philosophy. We here at <strong>desk</strong> don't believe price and quality should be mutually exclusive and want our customer to feel like they can still rely on our products despite the low price tag. Our aim create a stable relationship between our product and customer so you can always count on us to meet your stationary needs.</p>
